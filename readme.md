# PlanningCenter YouTube Integration

I wrote this script for our tech team at church, so they can easily create a YouTube stream from a service in PlanningCenter.


## Usage

### Installing a userscript manager

I recommend that you use [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), an open-source and privacy-focused userscript manager for your browser.

<details>

*[Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) is a great alternative option if you are using Firefox. But you will have to modify some code related to the `@grant` annotations like `GM_setValue`.*

*Tampermonkey is no longer open-source, so that's why I cannot recommend it.*
